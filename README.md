# Data-Driven-Optimization-of-Sperm-Selection-Efficiency
Project description: Sperm Selection Analysis

This project focuses on optimizing sperm selection efficiency using a 
data-driven approach. Historical IVF laboratory data was analyzed to 
Understand sperm quality and selection patterns and outcomes. The 
Study focuses on identifying patterns that influence fertilization 
Success. 

Business Objectives:

The primary business objective of this analysis is to understand how sperm selection parameters, embryologist expertise, and laboratory conditions influence the fertilization success and usable embryo formation, and enabling IVF clinics to:

•	Improve clinical success rates

•	Reduce repeat treatment cycles

•	Optimize Operational efficiency

•	Enhance patient satisfaction and trust

Project workflow:

Handled missing values, duplicates and inconsistent entries

Standardized data formats for analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Identified Fertilization failure trends

Visualization (Power BI)

Created dashboard showing fertilization success patterns 

Insights:

o	Highlighted major components which are effected the fertilization success

o	Detected that Embryologists performance are based on their experience

o	Provided data-driven recommendation to improve the fertilization success rate 

Tools:

Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Excel

SQL

Power BI

Statistical Analysis

Outcome:

While the fertilization success rate stands at 59.75%, the significantly lower 23.87% usable embryo rate reveals the true business challenge. By focusing on outcome-driven KPIs, skilled human resources, and standardized processes, IVF clinics can achieve higher efficiency, better patient trust, and sustainable business growth through data-driven decision-making.
