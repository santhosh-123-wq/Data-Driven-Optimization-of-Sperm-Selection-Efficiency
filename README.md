# Data-Driven-Optimization-of-Sperm-Selection-Efficiency
Project description: Sperm Selection Analysis
This project focuses on optimizing sperm selection efficiency using a 
data-driven approach. Historical IVF laboratory data was analyzed to 
Understand sperm quality and selection patterns and outcomes. The 
Study focuses on identifying patterns that influence fertilization 
Success. 
Business Objectives:
The primary business objective of this analysis is to understand how sperm selection parameters, embryologist expertise, and laboratory conditions influence the fertilization success and usable embryo formation, and enabling IVF clinics to:
•	Improve clinical success rates
•	Reduce repeat treatment cycles
•	Optimize Operational efficiency
•	Enhance patient satisfaction and trust
Project workflow:
Handled missing values, duplicates and inconsistent entries
Standardized data formats for analysis
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Identified Fertilization failure trends
Visualization (Power BI)
Created dashboard showing fertilization success patterns 
Insights:
o	Progressive motility impact (gives 63.1% success at >50% motility rate)
o	Sperm with “Normal” shape (gives 64% success at >10% normal rate)
o	Embryologists’ performance variance (Embryologists with higher experience have 68% success and embryologists with lower experience have 52% success rate (16% gap))
o	Lab Humidity Optimization (gives 62.4% success at 50-55%)
Tools:
Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Excel
SQL
Power BI
Statistical Analysis
Outcome:
While the fertilization success rate stands at 59.75%, the significantly lower 23.87% usable embryo rate reveals the true business challenge. By focusing on outcome-driven KPIs, skilled human resources, and standardized processes, IVF clinics can achieve higher efficiency, better patient trust, and sustainable business growth through data-driven decision-making.
